       <h1>Welcome</h1>
       <p>Greetings, and welcome to my website. I am Ben Blais, a web developer currently working for Progress Software. I developed this website as a way for me to both showcase my abilities as a developers as well as give me something to do in my free time.</p>

       <p>Here you will find several of my personal coding projects, some of them have not been updated since their creation, back when I was in college, so please be kind. All the source code for my projects can be found on GitHub so feel free to fork and modify to your liking.</p>
