        <h2>Compose Online</h2>
        <p>This was a project I did for my GUI programming course in college. It utilized the Web Audio Framework to make musical compositions as well as the canvas APIs for the staf and note drawing. It also includes a custom build of the KineticJS canvas library; I modified it to allow for the usage of drag and drop onto specific elements.</p>

        <h2>Campain Setting</h2>
        <p>Originally intended for a one-off campaign, I made the Shadowlance setting and have continued to expand on it. My players and myself are now several years into this game. I finally decided to make a stylized website for this setting. I have licensed it under creative commons and provided the source code for those wishing to use it, or draw upon it for their games.</p>
