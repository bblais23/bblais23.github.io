        <h2>Compose Online</h2>
        <p>This was a project I did for my GUI programming course in college. It utilized the Web Audio Framework to make musical compositions as well as the canvas APIs for the staf and note drawing. It also includes a custom build of the KineticJS canvas library; I modified it to allow for the usage of drag and drop onto specific elements.</p>
