       <h1>Welcome</h1>
       <p>Greetings, and welcome to my website. I am Ben Blais, a web developer currently working for Progress Software. I developed this website as a way for me to both showcase my abilities software development abilities, and give me something to do in my free time.</p>

       <p>Here you will find several of my personal coding projects, some of them are older, and have not been updated since their creation (back when I was in college) so there may be some compatibility issues with newer browsers. All the source code for my projects (including my website and blog) can be found on GitHub so feel free to fork and modify to your liking.</p>
