				<h1>Gear</h1>
				<p>
					Here's the stuff that I used for my day-to-day development. 
					Hardware, software, etc. I will update this periodically as things
					change and my schedule allows.

				<h2>Software</h2>

					<h2>Editor - Visual Studio Code</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/editor.png">
					<p>
						Like many developers these days, VSCode is my editor of choice. 
						I have all my plugins and dotfiles available on my dotfiles repo (below).

					<h2>Video Recording/Streaming - Streamlabs OBS</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/recording.png">
					<p>
						This is an electron app that is based on the popular OBS studio. It has 
						better twitch integration as well as a much better UI. Those familiar 
						with OBS Studio will recognize the ability to select windows, screens, 
						and configure scenes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						One thing to note is that this is more heavy-weight, so if your machine
						is chugging to keep up, I would go for OBS studio instead. A weird, but not
						uncommon issue I did find was VSCode and other electron apps won't record properly.
						I suspect this may be due to using hardware encoding while using hardware 
						acceleration on electron apps makes hard to capture a window.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since I have used OBS studio recently I have also included a link to it at the bottom.

					<h2>Monitors - Acer G246HL</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/monitor.jpg">
					<p>
						I have three of these that I attached to my mounting bracket,
						they have served me well these few years and provide good color,
						resolution, and contrast. They are are 1080p (not 4k or 2k) so 
						they will not provide that sort of resolution.
						These are good for both gaming as well as development and using them
						with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a>
						has probably saved my eyes.

					<h2>Monitor Mount - SLYPNOS Triple Monitor Mount</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/monitorMount.jpg">
					<p>
						This mount is fairly sturdy, has good movement and can be fairly customized.
						While some arms only allow you to move screens forward and back, this one gives
						you 3 dimensions  of movement.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a few downsides to this mount, the arms are not wide enough to hold
						all three of my monitors in landscape orientation, this is not a problem for me,
						since I like to have my right-most one in portrait, but it is a thing to be aware
						of.

					<h2>Headphones - SteelSeries Arctis 7</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/headphones.jpg">
					<p>
						Probably not the best sound quality, but better than what I am used to. 
						They are wireless, can be charged in less than 2hrs, and have battery
						life of for days. Comfort-wise, the pads feel good and I sometimes forget
						I am wearing them. Software is rather lightweight and non-buggy, the seperate
						"game" and "chat" audio channels are nice but I hardly ever use them.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the drawbacks I have found is the battery indicator will not reset
						after charging unless the headphones are turned on and plugged in via usb into
						the computer. So if you have these and you are wondering why they are still
						blinking red after being charged for 7hrs, there's your answer.

					<h2>Keyboard - Code V3 104-Key (Cherry MX Brown)</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/keyboard.jpg">
					<p>
						Many high-end keyboards on the market like you to install some bloating
						software for them to work. This one does none of that. All the features 
						(including switching the CTRL and CMD keys for Macs) is done through switches
						on the back. Cord is detatchable so if the wire breaks you can simply replace
						it instead of cracking the whole thing open and soldering a new one on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cherry MX Brown because it's more quite when you are around other people.
