					<p>
						I have three of these that I attached to my mounting bracket,
						they have served me well these few years and provide good color,
						resolution, and contrast. They are are 1080p (not 4k or 2k) so 
						they will not provide that sort of resolution.
						These are good for both gaming as well as development and using them
						with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a>
						has probably saved my eyes.

					<h2>Monitor Mount</h2>

					<p>
						This mount is fairly sturdy, has good movement and can be fairly customized.
						While some arms only allow you to move screens forward and back, this one gives
						you 3 dimensions  of movement.

						There are a few downsides to this mount, the arms are not wide enough to hold
						all three of my monitors in landscape orientation, this is not a problem for me,
						since I like to have my left-most one in portrait, but it is a thing to be aware
						of.
