					<h2>Monitors - Acer G246HL</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/monitor.jpg">
					<p>
						I have three of these that I attached to my mounting bracket,
						they have served me well these few years and provide good color,
						resolution, and contrast. They are are 1080p (not 4k or 2k) so 
						they will not provide that sort of resolution.
						These are good for both gaming as well as development and using them
						with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a>
						has probably saved my eyes.

					<h2>Monitor Mount - SLYPNOS Triple Monitor Mount</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/monitorMount.jpg">
					<p>
						This mount is fairly sturdy, has good movement and can be fairly customized.
						While some arms only allow you to move screens forward and back, this one gives
						you 3 dimensions  of movement.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a few downsides to this mount, the arms are not wide enough to hold
						all three of my monitors in landscape orientation, this is not a problem for me,
						since I like to have my left-most one in portrait, but it is a thing to be aware
						of.

					<h2>Headphones - SteelSeries Arctis 7</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/headphones.jpg">
					<p>
						Probably not the best sound quality, but better than what I am used to. 
						They are wireless, can be charged in less than 2hrs, and have battery
						life of for days. Comfort-wise, the pads feel good and I sometimes forget
						I am wearing them. Software is rather lightweight and non-buggy, the seperate
						"game" and "chat" audio channels are nice but I hardly ever use them.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the drawbacks I have found is the battery indicator will not reset
						after charging unless the headphones are turned on and plugged in via usb into
						the computer. So if you have these and you are wondering why they are still
						blinking red after being charged for 7hrs, there's your answer.

					<h2>Keyboard - Code V3 104-Key (Cherry MX Brown)</h2>
					<img class="thumbnail" src="/lib/images/keyboard.jpg">
					<p>
						Many high-end keyboards on the market like you to install some bloating
						software for them to work. This one does none of that. All the features 
						(including switching the CTRL and CMD keys for Macs) is done through switches
						on the back. Cord is detatchable so if the wire breaks you can simply replace
						it instead of cracking the whole thing open and soldering a new one on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cherry MX Brown because it's more quite when you are around other people.
