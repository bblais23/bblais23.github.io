# Welcome
Greetings, and welcome to my website. I am Ben Blais, a software engineer currently working for Embark Veterinary. 
I built this website as a way for me to both showcase my abilities as a developer, and give me something to do in my free time.

Here you will find a select subset of my personal coding projects. If you would like to see the full list they can be found on my [GitHub](http://github.com/bblais23). 
You can also find the full source code for all my projects there. Feel free to browse fork or contribute.
