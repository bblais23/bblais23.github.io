        <p>This was a project I did for my GUI programming course in college, it utilized the Web Audio Framework to make musical compositions, it also utilized the canvas APIs for the staf and note drawing as well as a custom build of KineticJS that I modified to allow for the usage of drag and drop onto specific elements.</p>
